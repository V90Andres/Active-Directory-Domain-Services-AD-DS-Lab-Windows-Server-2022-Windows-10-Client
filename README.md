# Active-Directory-Domain-Services-AD-DS-Lab-Windows-Server-2022-Windows-10-Client
A hands-on IT lab demonstrating the setup, configuration, and management of a Windows Server 2022 domain controller integrated with a Windows 10 client. Includes Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, and Group Policy configuration in a simulated enterprise environment.


# üß© Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Lab  
### Windows Server 2022 & Windows 10 Client Configuration

---

## üìò Overview
This project simulates a **corporate IT infrastructure** using **Oracle VirtualBox**, where I deployed and configured:
- A **Windows Server 2022** virtual machine acting as a **Domain Controller (DC)**, **DNS**, and **DHCP** server.
- A **Windows 10 Pro client** joined to the **Active Directory domain** `lab.local`.

The lab demonstrates **user management, domain authentication, DHCP IP assignment**, and **Group Policy configuration** ‚Äî replicating core responsibilities of a **Systems Administrator** or **IT Support Engineer** in a real-world business environment.

## üß© Configuration Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Configure Active Directory (AD DS)
- Promoted Windows Server 2022 to a **Domain Controller**.
- Created domain: `lab.local`.
- Installed supporting roles:
  - **DNS Server**
  - **DHCP Server**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DHCP
- Defined DHCP scope: `192.168.10.0/24`.
- Assigned default gateway and DNS options.
- Verified client IP assignment through **Address Leases**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Organisational Unit (OU)
- Created **OU: LabUsers** inside `lab.local`.
- Protected the OU from accidental deletion.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create Domain Users
- Added domain users inside `LabUsers` OU:
  - `john.lab`
  - `mary.lab`
- Assigned secure test passwords.
- Verified group membership and domain authentication.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Join Windows 10 Client to Domain
- Joined workstation to `lab.local`.
- Rebooted and logged in using domain credentials:
